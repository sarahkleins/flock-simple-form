# Flock Simple Form

After cloning the repo, run `npm install` or `yarn install`.

Run `npm start` or `yarn start` to see the the project running on `localhost: 3000`.

The form validates a correct email address on user input and displays a corresponding red / green icon.

## Next steps

### Build out the test suite.
  - Debug the shallow test in `SimpleForm.test.js`.
  - Use mount for more advanced testing.
  - Write a test that checks whether the component correctly validates an email address.
  
### Password validation!
  - Make sure a user's password and password confirmation match.
  - This would add to the validateFields() method.

### Build out the onSubmit function
  - Alert the user to any validation errors in the email and password fields.
  - Prompt the user to fix any errors before submitting.
